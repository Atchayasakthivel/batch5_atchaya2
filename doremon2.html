        <p><strong> his debut in the original manga’s release back in 1969, the futuristic blue robotic cat Doraemon has been capturing the hearts of kids and adults alike.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>For many of us who didn’t grow up in Japan, Doraemon was our first introduction to Japanese culture. We got to see what a typical home was like for these cartoon characters and what their life in Japan was like, albeit with a little bit of extra hijinx sprinkled in.

            Before we dive into the extent of the cultural impact and international influence that the Doraemon series holds, it’s worth explaining who and what Doraemon is for those who never got to know him.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>The creation of Doraemon<b></b></p>
            <p><i>Doraemon was created by Fujiko Fujio, which — you might be surprised to know — is actually the pen name for a duo of manga artists, Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The original published form of Doraemon first appeared in 1969 through the monthly children’s magazine, Shogakukan. Since the intended audience leaned towards the younger side, the story was written with a light-hearted tone to make it appealing to children.</i></p>
